# Technologies Used

HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# Approach Taken

I decided I wanted a fishing game. After presenting my idea to Akira, he suggested it would be doable on Canvas. I learnt Canvas first and got the main canvas up with the images. I then animated the fish and glass to move up and down within the game body.

DOM manipulation was added to the window to trigger the next screen if the player got the fish within the green glass, and more buttons and music added.

# Key Motivations

* Improving DOM manipulation
* Learning a new skill - Canvas
* Understand setInterval and clearInterval better

# Unsolved Problems

* Controlling the green glass of the game with a 'Flappy Bird' style movement
* Making the fish move randomly
* Creating a leaderboard
